# Meteor 1.3, React, Redux React Router, React Komposer

This is a very basic demo app that uses Meteor 1.3, React, Redux, React Router and React Komposer together.

There are quite a few tutorials and starter packages around using these packages, but I couldn't find any that used them all together. There were a few little hurdles so I've put this here to remind myself how to do it in future.
